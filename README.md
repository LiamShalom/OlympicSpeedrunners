Olympic Trials is a 2D platformer where you race against your own ghost through a dynamic map. 
In the level, you must navigate complex obstacles, avoid traps, and perform precise jumps as you try to outrun the ghost of your previous best time. 
The ghost mirrors your every move from your last attempt, challenging you to refine your speed and technique.
